"I want you to convert this project into an Angular project. Don’t make any changes to the existing content — everything should remain exactly as it is. Use the same code that’s already built, and just add a few new things to it."

Additions to the frontend:
Add a section titled “Choose a Health Service” with a beautiful heading.
Below the heading, create card-style components for each of the following services, with logos and beautiful hover effects:

GP Appointments

Cancer Checks

MRI | CT Scans

Physiotherapy

Below that, add a section called “Meet Our Partners” that includes different partner logos, such as:

Thriva

Vista

MMH

And many more

After that, create another section titled “How It Works” with a clear heading. Present the following steps in grid box format:

1. Search for your treatment
Filter your search based on location, price, and service type to find the right solution for you.

2. Compare options
Find services that suit your symptoms, budget, and location and compare them against each other in minutes.

3. Book your treatment
Book your service or treatment with our trusted partners and receive results to your phone – it's that simple.

Note:
Don’t make any changes to the original project — just set it up properly as an Angular project and add the above sections in order.
Make sure that padding, margin, height, width — all layout and spacing — are perfectly designed.
If needed, you may use TailwindCSS for styling, but be sure to deliver a beautiful design.
